Good night baby, I hope you have sweet dreams
We've turned the page on this day and now it's time to sleep
Good night baby, it's faster than it seems
I used to be the baby and my mom sang to me
Good night, good night, I watch you as you sleep
The world loves little babies and you are the world to me
Good night, good night, I watch you as you sleep
The world loves little babies and you are the world to me
