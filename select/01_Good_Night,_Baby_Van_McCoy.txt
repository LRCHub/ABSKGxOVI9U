Good night, baby
Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby
Dream, dream, dream

Wasn't it a cool the evening
Wasn't it a perfect night
Now the disco dance is over
And they're putting out the lights so

Good night, baby
Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby
Dream, dream, dream

Love you baby
Just you baby
Good night baby
Dream of me

I could dance my disco forever
Never and ever let you go
After turning on the music
Someone tell me, me tomorrow

Good night, baby
Good night, baby
Sleep tight, baby
Dream, dream, dream

Love you baby
Just you baby
Good night baby
Dream of me

Dream, dream, dream
